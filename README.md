# dataModel.OPCUA


### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [MachineTool](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OPCUA/blob/master/MachineTool/README.md). MachineTool is a mechanical device which is fixed (i.e. not mobile) and powered (typically by electricity and compressed air), typically used to process workpieces by selective removal/addition of material or mechanical deformation

- [MotionDeviceSystem](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OPCUA/blob/master/MotionDeviceSystem/README.md). MotionDeviceSystem provides a representation of a motion device system as an entry point to the OPC UA device set. This instance organises the information model of a complete robotics system using instances of the described ObjectTypes. A motion device system may consist of multiple motion devices, controllers and safety systems.

- [WoodworkingMachine](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OPCUA/blob/master/WoodworkingMachine/README.md). WoodworkingMachine is a machine that is intended to process wood.
